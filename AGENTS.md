# Repository AGENTS.md

This repository is a PRD → UI pipeline. The architecture is one core plus two runtime adapters.

## Layout

- `pipeline/` — the pnpm workspace; all commands run from here. The repo root has no package manifest.
- `pipeline/core/*` — runtime-neutral packages: `contracts`, `design-system`, `compiler`, `validators`, `renderer-html`, `orchestrator`, `asset-review`.
- `pipeline/runtimes/standalone` — file-system and model adapters plus the CLIs (`phase1:verify`, `render:html`, `asset:review`).
- `pipeline/runtimes/dsh` — dsh Cordis plugin/tools/headless adapter; bundles to `dist/plugin.js` with esbuild.
- `pipeline/dsh/home/profiles/prd-ui-assets` — project-local dsh profile. The profile definition is versioned; `node_modules/`, sessions, attachments, and credentials are ignored. Never modify `~/.dsh`; `DSH_HOME` points here.
- `pipeline/samples/` — `employee-app` (2-page mobile slice), `demo-crm`, and M0 asset fixtures (`assets/m0`, `assets/m0-scenarios`).
- `pipeline/artifacts/employee-app/` — checked-in rendered HTML and screenshots.
- `spike/` — historical Phase 0 Figma spike with its own pnpm workspace; read-only context, do not rewrite.
- `pipeline/docs/asset-review-m0.md` — M0 asset-review usage.
- `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` — project overview and change record.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/` — design specs. `docs/superpowers/plans/` — historical plans; paths there are historical and should not be rewritten.

## Commands

Run from `pipeline/`:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test                 # vitest: core/** and runtimes/**; excludes dsh integration
pnpm test:dsh             # real pinned dsh + local mock; no real key/network
pnpm exec vitest run core/asset-review/tests/gates.test.ts   # focused test
pnpm typecheck             # tsc --noEmit for every workspace package

pnpm phase1:verify --project samples/projects/employee-app/project.yaml --runs /tmp/employee-app-runs
pnpm render:html --run /tmp/employee-app-runs/<runId> --out /tmp/employee-app-html
pnpm asset:review --project samples/projects/employee-app/project.yaml --assets samples/assets/m0 --runtime standalone --runs /tmp/m0-runs

# Real dsh: export .env first; the CLI does not auto-load it.
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
DSH_HOME="$PWD/dsh/home" pnpm asset:review --project samples/projects/employee-app/project.yaml --assets samples/assets/m0 --runtime dsh --runs /tmp/m0-runs-dsh
```

- With no options, `pnpm phase1:verify` runs the 8-page `demo-orders` sample; the
  employee-app project is the current 2-page acceptance slice.
- `--runtime dsh` for asset review needs a vision key; `standalone` with the
  scripted reviewer is the keyless path.
- `pnpm test:dsh` fails with an install hint if the pinned dsh binary is
  missing; only `SKIP_DSH=1` skips it.
- There is no lint or format script; `pnpm typecheck` is the static gate.

Current expected evidence: 350 tests passing, `pnpm test:dsh` 1 passed,
typecheck clean, `Phase 1A OK: 2 pages, 0 blockers` for employee-app,
`13 assets / 13 passed` standalone, scenarios `1 passed / 1 unresolved`, and
real dsh `deepseek-flash` `13 assets / 13 passed` with
`usageSource=json-events`, `usageComplete=true`, and review cost ≈¥0.35
(10 CNY default cap).

## Architecture boundaries

- `core/` is runtime-neutral: it must not import `@deepseek-ai/*` or any runtime adapter.
- Dependency direction: `contracts` ← `design-system` ← `compiler` / `validators` /
  `renderer-html`; `orchestrator` composes them; `asset-review` depends only on `contracts`.
- Runtime adapters implement core ports. The core state machine owns retries,
  source fallback, budgets, and manifest freezing; dsh reviews one candidate per
  attempt. Do not duplicate state-machine logic in an adapter.
- New runtime-neutral behavior belongs in `core/`; file-system, model, and
  process wiring belongs in `runtimes/`.
- `runtimes/dsh` is the only package that builds `dist/` (esbuild `prepare`);
  the other packages are consumed as TypeScript source via tsx/vitest.
- SVG→PNG rendering lives in `runtimes/standalone`; `@resvg/resvg-js` must not
  be imported by `runtimes/dsh` or its esbuild bundle.
- dsh review tasks use `--json -` with the task on stdin; verdict comes from
  `final.text`, usage from `status(step_end)`. Do not add a second transport.

## Conventions

- ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`). TypeScript is `strict` with
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `moduleResolution: Bundler`, and `noEmit`.
- Relative imports use an explicit `.js` extension in TS sources (e.g. `./ids.js`).
- Tests live in each package's `tests/` directory and are included in that
  package's `tsconfig`; vitest collects `core/**/*.test.ts` and
  `runtimes/**/*.test.ts`, but the default config excludes the dsh integration
  test so `pnpm test` stays offline. Run `pnpm test:dsh` for that path.
- Workspace packages are referenced as `@prd-ui/*` with `workspace:*`.

## Gotchas

- `pipeline/.env` (gitignored) holds `PRD_UI_VISION_API_KEY`, `_BASE_URL`, and
  `_MODEL`; `.env.example` is the template. Never commit keys.
- The CLI does not auto-load `.env`; run `set -a; . ./.env; set +a` before a
  real dsh/model review.
- Review pricing lives in `pipeline/pricing.json`; update it when the provider
  or peak/off-peak pricing changes. The default dsh review cap is 10 CNY.
- The dsh CLI and bundles are pinned to `0.2.1-rc.2`; do not use `@next`.
  Smoke test: `DSH_HOME="$PWD/dsh/home" ./node_modules/.bin/dsh --profile prd-ui-assets 'Return {"ok":true}'`.
- `runs/` is gitignored and is the only agent output location. The renderer
  consumes a completed `manifest.json` (`complete: true`).
- `README.md`'s Phase 1A section still shows the 8-page sample; use the
  employee-app commands above for the current slice.

## Rules

- Do not import `@deepseek-ai/*` from `core/`.
- Do not write final handoff from agents; only `runs/<id>/`.
- Never commit keys or `.env`; only `.env.example`.
- Keep the employee-app `pnpm phase1:verify` at 2 pages / 0 blockers.
- Local commits only; no push.
